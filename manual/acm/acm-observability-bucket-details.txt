From the UI, you can get the bucket claim connection details, for example:

Object Bucket Claim Data
Endpoint
s3.openshift-storage.svc:443
Bucket Name
acm-observability-bucket-6491814c-586a-4fdf-8c14-3af63cd2fbc4
Access Key
VIb09xNh9D7oMYKHizFY
Secret Key
qwhSVrxJhR11dQr1OqcFT72YLbN4GYUoEmRXJ1vB

Need to determine how to get this from the CLI

These can be extracted from the secret and the configmap with the same name as the bucket:

oc get secret acm-observability-bucket -n open-cluster-management-observability -o jsonpath="{.data}"
oc get configmap acm-observability-bucket -n open-cluster-management-observability -o jsonpath="{.data}"

Note also that the observability-thanos-stare-shard* pods will return a x509 error:
